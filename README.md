## ðŸš€ Why did I do this?

The original documentation was confusing â€” so this version rebuilds the docs from the ground up to be:

- ðŸ“š **Beginner-friendly** â€“ Clear explanations and usage examples.
- âš¡ **Developer-focused** â€“ Practical guidance, not just API dumps.
- ðŸ§© **Component-based** â€“ Modular UI components that scale with your app.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Customizable** â€“ Easily theme or extend components.
